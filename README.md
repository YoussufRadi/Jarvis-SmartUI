Home and building monitoring is a poplar IoT application that relies on a variety of sensors to measure certain attributes such as temperature, humidity, room occupancy, etc. Modern systems allow a degree of control over some of the home appliances including lighting control, control of locks, coffee machines, etc. In this project we will build a home monitoring system that can be controlled using voice recognition commands. The system should be trained to recognize human voice and follow certain instructions accordingly. The system should also be adaptive to detect certain patterns of user and adapt accordingly.
